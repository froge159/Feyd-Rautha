        Born to Abulurd Rabban as part of the Bene Gesserit breeding program, Feyd-Rautha Rabban was his father's hope for a son who would not have to inherit the dishonor of his wicked family's Harkonnen name, and envisioned him as a worthy heir to his throne, unlike his older and more brutal brother, Glossu.

However, Vladimir Harkonnen, the ruthless and greedy Siridar-Baron of House Harkonnen, decided to take Feyd-Rautha under his wing and raise him on the Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime. He entitled Feyd as his own heir and changed his last name to Harkonnen, showing him much favor over Glossu. As such, Feyd-Rautha grew up to be charismatic, sadistic, and vicious, with an unending lust for blood and power.

Feyd's role in the breeding program was meant to have him marry a daughter of House Atreides in a hope to end their feud and produce the prophesized Kwisatz Haderach. However, the Atreides concubine, Lady Jessica, gave birth to a son, Paul Atreides, instead of a daughter, and the union not only became impossible, but an irreconcilable tension between Feyd and Paul formed, as both were the scions of their bitterly-opposed noble houses. To preserve the Harkonnen bloodline and maintain millennia of genetic engineering, a Bene Gesserit envoy, Margot Fenring, was sent in to seduce Feyd and conceive his child using hypnotic suggestion.

        The Baron planned a strategic marital alliance, hoping to marry Feyd to Princess Irulan Corrino, the eldest daughter of the Emperor Shaddam IV, an act that would give the Harkonnens influence over the throne. To promote Feyd's power, he was to be installed as ruler of Arrakis after a period of tyrannical misrule by his brother Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the populace and a worthy heir to the imperial throne.

Feyd's ambition and impatience to inherit the Baron's title and power allowed him to be manipulated by Thufir Hawat, a Mentat of the Atreides who was captured by the Baron. Both the Baron and Feyd were nearly assassinated as a result of Hawat's machinations.

        Feyd was famed for his prowess in single combat, as well as his willingness to break the formal rules of kanly that governed specific types of competitive challenges. By using a hidden poison spur in his fighting outfit, he nearly succeeded in killing Paul in ritualized single combat. During this time, Paul was deciding whether to try the paralysis command and owe the Bene Gesserit his victory or risk his life against Feyd in a "fair" fight. Paul ultimately decided not to use the command and killed Feyd by thrusting his crysknife up his jaw and into his brain.
